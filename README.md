# Wipe Rename
This Python application is a script designed to batch rename .tga image files within a specified folder. It allows the user to:

Specify the folder containing the .tga files.
Provide a new base name for the files.
The script then renames all .tga files in the folder to follow the format {base_name}_XXX.tga, where XXX is a sequential number starting from 000. It sorts the files alphabetically before renaming to maintain a consistent order and prints messages indicating the progress of the renaming operation.
